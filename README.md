# cardsorting
A game to teach sorting algorithms

## Background
This project is the answer to a pretty specific pedagogical question.
I have to teach a class with a few interesting properties: 1) it is about computer science, and
2) the class is too short to develop any coding skills, which I can't assume the students have.
I want to talk about analysis of running times to motivate P vs NP towards the end, but how can 
you do that without timing some algorithms on large test cases? Hopefully this is a reasonable
way of doing the sorting by hand and motivating them to think about the number of comparisons
they're using.

## How to contribute
Do anything you like. If you have ideas or notice bugs, please let me know.
